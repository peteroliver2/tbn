  hack tattoo update. I don't know if anyone remembers, but a little over a year ago I tattooed Skeith's wand on my arm. Just today I tattooed AIDA behind the wand.

His torso and abdomen are once again exposed, and in the games now covered by a light purple coloring with a red tattoo on it, akin to his initial 1st form. His facial marks are two curves on his cheeks, each with multiple juts coming out as they run down his face, likening to scars. Does the colour of the tattoos not matter, then? Because Elk's tattoos appear to be green, but he's listed as Darkness, and BlackRose's appear to be tan and she's Fire. --DameGreyWulf , 24 September (UTC) Where the wave symbol info comes from.
