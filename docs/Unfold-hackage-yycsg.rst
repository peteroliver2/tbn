This package provides one. Example unfolds are: Random values. Enumeration of all values (depth-first or breadth-first). Convert from a list. An Unfold is a source or a producer of a stream of values. It takes a seed value as an input and unfolds it into a sequence of values. A tutorial on the universality and expressiveness of fold. J. Functional Programming 9 (4): –, July that is available at the URL: 

Data structures that can be unfolded. For example, given a data type. data Tree a = Empty | Leaf a | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a) a suitable instance would be. instance Unfoldable Tree where unfold fa = choose [ pure Empty, Leaf fa, Node unfold fa fa unfold fa ] i.e. it follows closely the instance for Traversable, but instead of matching on an input value, we choose . r is just the same, it uses the same step function: >>>  $  (r f) [1,2,3][1,2,3] The input of an unfold can be transformed using lmap: >>> u =  (fmap (+1)) st>>>  $  u [][2,3,4,5,6]Copyright: (c) Composewell Technologies. Folds a list of Expr s into a single Expr. (cf. unfold) This always generates an ill-typed expression. fold [val False, val True, val (Int)] [False,True,1]:: ill-typed # ExprList $ Bool #. This is useful when applying transformations on lists of Expr s, such as canonicalize, mapValues or canonicalVariations.
